use `npm install` on both root (weather-check) folder
and then `cd client` -> `npm install` so both node and react dependencies will be installed.

then `cd ..` back to root to run the app.

run it with `npm run dev`.



First time implementing web crawler (scraper). 

as you load the page , you'll have a loading icon (as it takes it a bit longer to fetch from the scraping)

the cards of the cities will update every few seconds.

while using the search it will filtered using a city name (ra'anana will need a ' as its using the city name as the param)

after it filtered it out it will update again and show all the cards.
